### About
This repository contains high-quality assets (PSD and exports) recreated from scratch in Adobe Photoshop 2019. The goal of this project is preservation and high-resolution restoration for nostalgic and educational purposes.

> [!NOTE]
> Many layers utilize the Vector Mask Feather property. Please note that this value is absolute and will not automatically scale when elements are resized in any way.
> I used a .jsx script written by AI to change these values, as I don't understand these scripts. I've included it in the repository, but use it with caution.
